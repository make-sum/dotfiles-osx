# - Basic Utilities: bash-compilition2 (https://github.com/scop/bash-completion)
#   moreutils(https://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/), autojump (https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump): a faster way to navigate
#   your filesystem, ponysay(https://github.com/erkin/ponysay/) - enables pony to speak.
# - Tree (http://mama.indstate.edu/users/ice/tree/): A directory listing utility
#   that produces a depth indented listing of files.

# - Languages: rvm (Ruby), nvm (Node.js), python 3
# - Fuck (https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck): Correct your previous command. Note
#   that this needs to be added to zsh or bash. See the project README.
# - git-extras (https://vimeo.com/45506445): Adds a shit ton of useful commands to git.
# - ffmpeg (https://ffmpeg.org/): Converting video and audio has never been so easy.
# Note that I install nvm (https://github.com/creationix/nvm) instead
# of installing Node directly. This gives me more explicit control over
# which version I'm using.
